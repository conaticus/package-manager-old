# Node Package Manager

## About
Note: You can find my more complete and improved version of this [here](https://github.com/conaticus/click).

A neat little package manager hooked up to the NPM registry made in Rust. This took me 2 days so it has a few issues, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.
